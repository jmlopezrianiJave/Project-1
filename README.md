Audacity Trailer project by Jose Miguel Lopez and Juan Sebastian Garizao

The project we undertook consisted of transforming the context of a trailer for an unreleased movie or video game by altering its audio. We chose to work with the trailer for Avatar: Fire and Ash, part of James Cameron’s globally recognized action franchise. While the original film presents a highly serious tone, our objective was to reimagine the preview as a comedy trailer.

To achieve this, we incorporated slapstick sound effects that lightened the intensity of the battle and action sequences. We also added humorous dialogues to shift the context of the scenes. Our main source of inspiration was El Paseo, a well-known series of Colombian comedy films. In addition, we integrated popular sound effects commonly used in internet “memes” to further reinforce the comedic tone of the trailer.
